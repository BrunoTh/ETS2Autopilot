# Update 21.11.2018

I decided to stop the development on this project. I will create a new version of the autopilot which will be much easier to use. Therefore, I will create a new project from scratch to improve the design. This will take some time, as I've been a bit busy lately. Please stay tuned.

Feel free to check out the project website for more information and development progress. I will also recreate it soon: https://www.ets2autopilot.com/

### Problems
If you get an error message like this `error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '[..]\ETS2Autopilot-master\python\python35.zip\lib2to3\Grammar.txt'` during installing python modules, follow these steps:
- go to the directory `python\`
- rename the file `python35.zip` to something like `python35x.zip`
- extract the content of the renamed ZIP-file to a **folder** named `python35.zip`
